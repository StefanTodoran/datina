/*
 * << HOW TO ADD EVENT POSTS >>
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Read all of the instructions before making ANY changes!!
 * 
 * The const below contains a list of javascript objects. Each object represents an event,
 * and contains the following properties:
 *
 * "title"
 * The title of the event. Keep it short or it will look weird.
 * 
 * "date"
 * The date the of the event, written in the format "Day, Month 00th, YEAR",
 * or to give an example for clarity: "Tue, Dec 23rd 2025"
 * 
 * "img"
 * The path to the image to be displayed for the event. If you place the image in the "events" 
 * folder, the path will be "events/IMAGE_NAME.png" where IMAGE_NAME is the name you give your 
 * image. Make SURE the extension matches what your image has, i.e. ".png" or ".jpg" don't just assume.
 *
 * 
 * The events are displayed in the order they are listed in the const. You can re-order them
 * if you'd like, and should delete past events. Copy and past the below template into the list 
 * to get started.
 * 
 * TEMPLATE:

  {
    "title": "TITLE_HERE",
    "date": "Day, Month 00th 2022",
    "img": "events/IMAGE_NAME.png",
  },
